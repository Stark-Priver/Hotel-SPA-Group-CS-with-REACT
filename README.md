# Hotel Webpage Interface

This project is a simple hotel webpage interface developed using React. The purpose is to demonstrate component-based architecture, state management, and styling.

## Project Description

The interface consists of three main sections:
1. **Header:** Displays the hotel name and navigation links.
2. **Main Content Area:** Provides an overview of the hotel, services offered, and images.
3. **Footer:** Includes contact information and links to social media.

The project is designed to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and easily maintainable, meeting the assignment requirements for Group 2.

## Features

- Component-based architecture:
  - Reusable components for the Header, Navigation, Main Content, and Footer.
- Styled using a dedicated `App.css` file for a cohesive design.
- Extendable functionalities like adding more components, routing, or API integrations.
